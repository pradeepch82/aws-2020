Module 1: AWS Cloud essentails -an overview
============================================
1.What Cloud is about?
2.When to use cloud?
3.When to not use cloud? 
4.Types of clouds : 
  private
  public
  hybrid
  community

  IAAS
  PAAS
  SAAS
  CAAS
 
differnt usecases 

In Industry where AWS is being used?

  Building small simple website.
  Complex machine learning analytics.


Module 2:AWS Fundamentals
============================
What AWS has to offer?

  Compute => EC2,ECS,EKS...
        
  Storage => S3, RDS, DynamoDB
  Networking => VPC,Router53
  Security =>Firewalls,IAM,Macy



Module 3:AWS console and usage
===============================
Interaction with AWS
 1.AWS console Web UI (Easiest way to ineract with amazon)
 2.CLI
 3.SDK (Jaormationva,Python0
 4.Cloud Formation (automatic way)


Module 4:AWS Software Development Kit nad Command Line tool kit
==================================================================
1.We can write programs in different languages
2.Using CLI we can run commands which automatially it create a server


Module 5:Monitoring and Metrics
==================================
Once we create a application in cloud we need to monitor the application 
for performance and availability (Cloud Watch  similar to task manager)




Module 6:High Availability :
===========================
If server is busy and using 100% CPU we need to add one more server It may crash or hang

Scale up or scale down

if (cpu >80 ) add another server

Ecommerce Flipcart IRCTC,Aamazon avialable 24/7   doesn't cause customer distruption or any
busienss impact

Mumbai (website) 
Sydney (website) 
Tokyo  (website) 

Monitoring and autoscaling works together.

Module 7:Analysis and Data Managment
====================================
Multiple ways to store the data

EBS (Elastic Block storage) =>Hard disk
S3  (Simple Storage Service) =>Folders and Files
RDS RDBMS in cloud

Given a particular requirement what to pick and what not to pick.


Module 8:Security and networking
===================================
When we build the application we need to think about how to secure it
we need to save the data we need to encrypt the data.
when we send the data across the net work we have to encrypt the data
How to restrict access.

                         
  Production Users :  Server1 ,Server2,Server3

  Development Users : Server3 ,Server4,Server6


using IAM we can do this.


Module 9:Deployment and provisioning
======================================


    VPC ([ Load Balancer =>  (firewall[HDD=>Server=>RDS]) ] )


  Whole stack becomes very complicated
  If you create each one manually probality of missing something

  We need to automate using Cloud formation (YAML or JSON languages)

  YAML
    =>Server (big,small,medium)
    =>Linux,windows
    =>Tokyo,sydney
    =>RDS =>(MySQL,Postgreys)

  If you want to send documentation about how to set up server and RDS.
  
  you can create Cloud Formation template in yaml or json and share with customer.
  You can aotomat everything.

  Puppet
  chef
  ansible
  
Module 10:Big Data and analytics
===================================
Big data processing in cloud

Big Data
       ===> processing and storing huge amount of data
       


Module 11:Cloud Best practices
===============================
while constructing the building if foundation is not solid there can be structural
problem in building.

Module 12:Cost optimization
============================
We can create as many server as you want

Cost optimization at different level
compute
storage
databse
networking
we can deploy the application faster
we can save some money
================================================================================================





=============================================
Module 1: AWS Cloud essentails -an overview
=============================================
1.Basic Overvie of the cloud
2.Different types of cloud models and cloud services
3.Different vendors of cloud implementation
4.Features of AWS and Managed services offerings
5.Why to choose AWS
6.Real time use cases
Oppurtinities in Cloud/Market



If you want to create a website

Procurr h/w
Space room or building
security(guards,n/w security,application security)
Routers
Cooling

It takes couple of weeks

With cloud we have bunch of machines mainated,provisioned ,created by cloud vendor by AWS.



What is Cloud Computing ?
==========================
Cloud computing refers to the on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications via the internet with pay as you go pricing

Cloud computing is also a utility service giving you access to technology resources managed by experts and available on demand


Features of Cloud
===================
On-Demand Provisioning
Scalability in minutes
Pay Per consumption (No Long term commitments and upfront capital needed)
Abstract resources
Efficiency of Experts
Measurable



On Premise Vs AWS

On Premise ==> 30% focus on business  and 70% Managing all undifferentiated Heavy Lifting

AWS        ==> 70% focus on business and 30% on configuring your cloud assets

Edge Location

Global Infrastructure Zone


Region => AZ1 (DC1,DC2...) => AZ2 (DC1, DC2......)

IAM =>Global

Server,RDS =>Non Global =>Region specific

https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructue

https://aws.amazon.com/console


Some objects are region specific like EC2,S3
AWS has most regions.Compared with others
For sake of compliane

Why regions
=============
Compliance 
High Availability
Latency

Edge Location :
        For Content distrubution (Static HTML Pages,Audio or Videos)
	Cache the frequently user files


Compute Service
===============
	Compute Service is responsible for managing Virtual Server and dependent components like RAM,processor,network,storage
	
	1.Amazon EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute)
	      
	       : for provisioning a virtual machine along with CPU,RAM,Storage,n/w etc.

		Pricing Model
		  1.On Demand (per second basis with minimum 1 minute) : High costlier 
		  2.Reserved  (1 year ,3 year ,upfront payment discount ) :2 Most cheapest
		  3.Spot Instances   :1 Most cheapest (App is tolerant to failures)



	2.Auto Scaling 
	       
	       : for configuring scaling up and down the number of the EC2 instances depending on configured metrics (ex.CPU utilization) for EC2 and RDS
	
	3.Elastic Load Balancing
	
		: for distrubuting traffic or load to underlying EC2 instances 
		: This service has capabilities to monitor the underlying EC2 instances and distrubute the traffic to the active nodes.   

	4.Amazon EMR (Elastic Map Reduce)
		
		:used for running batch jobs to process huge amounts of unstructured data
		:AWS uses customized instances and provides  a Apache Map/Reduce platform to execute big data related batch jobs
                           
                         
                        Spark,Hive,Pig,Sqoop,Oozie,MAp Reduce

                                 upload the data in aws
				 upload the code in aws
				 run the job

		3.Automatically creates
			Webserver
			Database
			Loade balancer
			Auto scaling
